In order to compile our code, you need to have OpenCV library installed in 
your computer. You can find more information in the following link:

http://opencv.org/

After installing the OpenCV library, you can compile the code as follows:

g++ FASA.cpp -I "OpenCV include path" -L "OpenCV library path" -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -o FASA

Please modify the "OpenCV include path" and "OpenCV library path" according
to your computer (without the quotes).

===========================================================================
HOW TO RUN?
===========================================================================

After compiling the code, you can run the code with following variables:

FASA —i -p /path/to/input/image/folder/ -f image_format -s /path/to/output/folder/
FASA —v -p /path/to/input/video/file.avi -s /path/to/output/folder/

image_format: Format of the images to be processed

Example: jpg
